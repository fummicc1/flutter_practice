# Dart

A launguage to build a UI for Flutter.

## main()

An entrypoint of application.

## Type

Dart has a type such as `int`, `string`, `List`, `bool`, `void`.

## Static Type Check

Dart checks type at compile time. We cannot assign `string` value to `int` variable like the following.

```swift
string name = 0; // compile-error: static type check fails
```
